Streamlit application for managing and executing patterns, with a focus on pattern creation, execution, and analysis. Below is a breakdown of the key components and functionality of the application:
Key Components and Functionality
    Logging Configuration:
        The application sets up logging with both console and file handlers.
        The console logs are color-coded for better readability, and the file logs are more detailed for debugging purposes.
    Session State Initialization:
        The initialize_session_state() function initializes the session state with default values for various configuration and UI states.
        It also loads saved outputs from persistent storage.
    Pattern Management:
        Pattern Creation: The create_pattern() function allows creating new patterns with either simple or advanced editing options.
        Pattern Deletion: The delete_pattern() function allows deleting existing patterns.
        Pattern Editing: The pattern_editor() function provides an interface for editing existing patterns.
    Pattern Execution:
        Pattern Execution: The execute_patterns() function executes selected patterns and captures their outputs.
        Pattern Chain Execution: The execute_pattern_chain() function executes a sequence of patterns in a chain, passing output from each pattern to the next.
    Output Management:
        Saving Outputs: The save_output_log() function saves pattern execution logs.
        Starring Outputs: The star_output() and unstar_output() functions allow users to star/favorite outputs for quick access.
    Configuration and Model Selection:
        Model and Provider Selection: The load_models_and_providers() function fetches and displays available models and providers for selection.
        Configuration Loading: The load_configuration() function loads environment variables and initializes the configuration.
    UI Components:
        Pattern Creation UI: The pattern_creation_ui() and pattern_creation_wizard() functions provide UI components for creating new patterns.
        Pattern Management UI: The pattern_management_ui() function provides UI components for managing patterns.
        Output Analysis UI: The application includes tabs for displaying all outputs and starred outputs, with options to copy or star outputs.
    Error Handling and Validation:
        Input Validation: The validate_input_content() and sanitize_input_content() functions validate and sanitize input content to ensure it is safe for processing.
        Pattern Validation: The validate_pattern() function validates the structure and content of a pattern.
    Main Function:
        The main() function orchestrates the entire application, setting up the Streamlit page, initializing session state, and handling the main navigation between different views (Run Patterns, Pattern Management, Analysis Dashboard).
Usage and Features
    Pattern Creation: Users can create new patterns using either a simple text editor or an advanced wizard.
    Pattern Execution: Users can select patterns to run, provide input, and execute them either individually or in a chain.
    Output Analysis: Users can view and analyze the outputs of executed patterns, star favorite outputs, and copy outputs to the clipboard.
    Pattern Management: Users can edit, delete, and bulk edit patterns.
    Configuration: Users can select different models and providers for pattern execution.
Error Handling and Logging
    The application includes robust error handling and logging to ensure that any issues are logged and displayed to the user.
    Logging is done both to the console and to a file for debugging purposes.
Future Enhancements

- Fixed : if there is no stdin, then a nil message was passed to pattern.go resulting in segfault.
now we make user input ' ', before processing.
- Revert "Fix pattern file usage without stdin"
This reverts commit 744ec0824be60ab39337d8cc92ea0552fcc2c31c.
- Fix pattern file usage without stdin
When using pattern files with variables but no stdin input, ensure proper
template processing by initializing an empty message. This allows patterns
like:
  ./fabric -p pattern.txt -v=name:value
to work without requiring stdin input, while maintaining compatibility
with existing stdin usage:
  echo "input" | ./fabric -p pattern.txt -v=name:value
Changes:
- Add empty message initialization in BuildSession when Message is nil

- Remove redundant template processing of message content
- Let pattern processing handle all template resolution
This simplifies the template processing flow while supporting both
stdin and non-stdin use cases.
- Merge branch 'curly-brace-templates' into feature/template-extensions
- Fixed : if there is no stdin, then a nil message was passed to pattern.go resulting in segfault.
now we make user input ' ', before processing.

- sys: System information and environment access
- text: String manipulation and formatting operations
Each plugin includes:
- Implementation with comprehensive test coverage

- Markdown documentation of capabilities
- Integration with template package
This builds on the template system to provide practical utility functions
while maintaining a focused scope for the initial plugin release.
- Ci: update patterns zip workflow

- Update patterns.go to use template package for variable processing
- Support special {{input}} handling for pattern content

- Update chatter.go and rest API to pass input parameter
- Enable multiple passes to handle nested variables

- Report errors for missing required variables
This change sets up a foundation for future templating features like front matter
and plugin support while keeping the substitution logic centralized.
- Refactor: unify pattern loading and variable handling

- Stronger separation of concerns between chatter.go and patterns.go
- Consolidate pattern loading logic into GetPattern method

- Support both file and database patterns through single interface

Allow patterns to be loaded directly from files using explicit path prefixes
(~/, ./, /, or \). This enables easier testing and iteration of patterns
without requiring installation into the fabric config structure.

- Supports relative paths (./pattern.txt, ../pattern.txt)
- Supports home directory expansion (~/patterns/test.txt)

- Supports absolute paths
- Maintains backwards compatibility with named patterns

- Requires explicit path markers to distinguish from pattern names
Example usage:
  fabric --pattern ./draft-pattern.txt
  fabric --pattern ~/patterns/my-pattern.txt
  fabric --pattern ../../shared-patterns/test.txt

of things to implement to get it working.
This applies to things like writing articles/papers, creating
applications, and much more.
